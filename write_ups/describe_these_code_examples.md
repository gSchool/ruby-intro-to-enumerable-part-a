### Describing Code:

Use terms like assigned, reassigned, statement, and concatenates to explain each of the following code examples:

1)

```
x = 7
```

**Response:**

The variable x is assigned the value integer of 7.

**Andreas' feedback:**
"integer value (word ordering) but yeah, nice!"

**My edited response with feedback:**
This is an expression: any piece of code that evaluates to a value (ex: x = 2 + 7 )
This is also a statement: A group of expressions to be carried out (or executed).

**THE ANSWER:**

The (Integer) value 7 is being assigned to the variable x



**RANDOM NOTES:**

ex: Multiple expressions that return a value. Combinations of expressions.

(3 * 2) + (3 * 4)
     6  +  12
      18

18 is the evaulation of the statement. Your evaluation. Evaluation is the process. It's been evaluated.

The variable x is assigned (assignment statement) the integer value of 7.

Evaluate is the process of getting a value from an expression or statement.

All expressions are statements, but not all statements are expressions.

Class: A class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created.
A collection of objects-- a class of objects-- for methods to be applied to.

Object: Something that is stored, can have methods called, or has a value has properties of
the originating class. Like a NOUN in English.

Methods: Method is action that can be called on an object. Like a VERB in English.

Concatenate: Combining strings.

Assign: Give an object a value.

Receiver: The object the method of which the method is called.

Argument: A parameter for a method.
(A perameter says when it's okay.)

Block: Holds method(s). ex: Block.call to reduce redundant data.


2)

```
fooey = "not foo"
puts fooey
```

**Response:**

Assignment statement where fooey is assigned the value of "not foo".

**My edited response:**
This is a statement: A group of expressions to be carried out (or executed).

The assignment of fooey = "not foo" and the return statement of puts fooey.

**THE ANSWER:**

The String, "not foo" is assigned to the variable foeey

3)

```
special_number = 1
special_number = 3
```

**Response:**

Assignment statement where special_number is assigned the value of "1" and "3".

**Andreas' feedback:**
"Really we are assigning the value 1 to special_number and then reassigning the value of special_number to be 3"

**My edited response:**
Assigning the value 1 to special_number and then reassigning the value of special_number to be 3.

**THE ANSWER:**
The (Integer) value 1 is being assigned to the variable special_number. The variable special_number is then reassigned the (Integer) value 3.

4)

```
1 + 2
```
**Response:**

Addition of two integers.

**Andreas' feedback:**
This response works, but ultimately we'd like to view this as a statement

**THE ANSWER:**
The statement adds (Integer) values 1 and 2.


5)

```
a = "foo"
b = "bar"
a + b

```

**Response:**

string concatenation evaluates to:
"foo" + "bar"

**Andreas' feedback:**
Remember what evaluation is? It's when it's reduced as much as possible. The full evaluated value will be "foobar"

**My edited response:**
a + b
"foo" + "bar"
"foobar"

**THE ANSWER:**
The String "foo" is assigned to the variable a. The String "bar" is assigned to the variable b. The statement concatenates Strings a and b.

6)

```
z = 9
z = z * 3
```

**Response:**

Multiplication of a variable with an integer using the operator *.
z is assigned a value of 9.

**THE ANSWER:**
The variable z is assigned the value 9. The variable z is then reassigned to the statement z*3(, which evaluates to the value 27).
