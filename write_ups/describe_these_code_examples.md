### Describing Code:

Use terms like assigned, reassigned, statement, and concatenates to explain each of the following code examples:

1)

```
x = 7
```

**Response:**
* `x` is assigned the value of `7` in the statement on line 8

2)

```
fooey = "not foo"
puts fooey
```

**Response:**
* `fooey` is assigned the value of the string `"not foo"` in the statement on line 17
* line 18 evaluates to the string "not fooey"


3)

```
special_number = 1
special_number = 3
```

**Response:**
* `special number` is assigned the value of `1` in the statement on line 29
* `special number` is reassigned the value of `3` in the statement on line 30

4)

```
1 + 2
```
**Response:**
* the expression on line 40 returns `3`


5)

```
a = "foo"
b = "bar"
a + b

```

**Response:**
* `a` is assigned the string `"foo"`
* `b` is assigned the string `"bar"`
* the expression on line 51 concatenates `b` onto `a`, returning a value of `"foobar"`


6)

```
z = 9
z = z * 3
```

**Response:**
* `z` is assigned the value of `9`
* `z` is reassigned the value of the expression `z * 3`
*  the evaluation of `z * 3` is `27`
* therefore `z` is reassigned to the value of `27` on line 65
