### Describing Code:

Use terms like assigned, reassigned, statement, and concatenates to explain each of the following code examples:

1)

```
x = 7
```

**Response: The integer 7 is assigned to x.**


2)

```
fooey = "not foo"
puts fooey
```

**Response: The string "not foo" is the value assigned to fooey.
The string "not foo" is printed as a string. **


3)

```
special_number = 1
special_number = 3
```

**Response: The variable special_number is assigned the integer 1.
The variable special_number is reassigned the integer 3. **

4)
```
1 + 2
```
**Response: The addition method is called on 1 (not sure if 2 is an argument
of the addition method). Another way to talk about this is: the statement is 1 + 2.**


5)

```
a = "foo"
b = "bar"
a + b

```

**Response:  The variable, a, is assigned the string "foo".  The variable, b, is assigned the string "bar".  The statement a + b concatenates the strings "foo" and "bar" evaluating to "foobar".**

6)

```
z = 9
z = z * 3
```

**Response: The variable, z, is assigned the integer 9. The variable, z, is reassigned the expression z * 3.
In the reassignment, the original value of 9 will be subbed in for z in the expression z * 3, and
the expression will evaluate to 27.**
